A simple trading strategy executor framework to run trading strategies written in Python.

# Example strategies

# Starting example strategies

To start the example strategy a, you can use make:

``` bash
> make start-a
```

To start the example strategy b, you can use make, but please make sure to stop the previously running strategy first,
so there won't be any issues around the used ports:

``` bash
> make stop
> make start-b
```
